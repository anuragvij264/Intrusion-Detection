# Problem statement
Software to detect network intrusions protects a computer network from unauthorized users. Learning the “signatures” of such attacks from a TCP dump is an important data mining Problem. A connection is a sequence of TCP packets starting and ending at some well defined times, between which data flows to and from a source IP address to a target IP address under some well defined protocol. Assuming the existence of a labelled sample of connection data in which each connection is labelled as either normal, or as an attack, with exactly one specific attack type, the learning task is to build a classifier capable of distinguishing between “bad” connections (intrusions or attacks), and “good” (normal) connections. The task is then extended to predict specific type of attack.
